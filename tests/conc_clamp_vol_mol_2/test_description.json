    "description": "This test checks that the proper average number of molecules is released by a concentration clamp either on both sides or a single side of a surface. The expected number of molecules is (0.2*0.2*0.2): 0.0001*6.0221417930e23*(0.2*0.2*0.2)/1e15 = 481.77, i.e., 482 number of molecules expected for release on both sides and 241 molecules for release on a single side.",
