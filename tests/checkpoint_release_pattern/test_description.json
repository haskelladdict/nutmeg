    "description": "This test checks that upon restart from a checkpoint, the molecule lifetimes and release events are correctly scheduled for checkpointed simulations in which individual runs have different timesteps. In MCell v 3.2.1 and earlier this behavior was broken since MCell assumed that previous runs had timesteps identical to the current one.",
