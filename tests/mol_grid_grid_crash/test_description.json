	"description" : "Under certain circumstances, mol-grid-grid reactions could lead to a crash.  The wrong variable was being used to index into the array of matching reactions in the mol-grid-grid case, causing mcell to access outside the bounds of the array.  This may not reliably fail, and may depend on the compiler and architecture.",
