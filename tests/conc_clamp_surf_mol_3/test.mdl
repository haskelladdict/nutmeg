/*
 * 
 * This test checks that the proper average number of surface molecules is
 * released by a surface concentration clamp on _the outer side_ 
 * of a clamped surface region.
 *
 * The total area of the sampling surface is 184 triangles with surface 
 * area 0.5*0.00625*0.00625 each. Thus, the total number of expected
 * molecules at the clamped surface is
 *
 * 0.5*0.00625*0.00625 * 184 * 5000 = 17.969
