    "description": "This test checks that the proper average number of surface molecules is released by a surface concentration clamp on _the outer side_ of a clamped surface region. The total area of the sampling surface is 184 triangles with surface  area 0.5*0.00625*0.00625 each. Thus, the total number of expected molecules at the clamped surface is 0.5*0.00625*0.00625 * 184 * 5000 = 17.969. NOTE: The tolerances were chosen based on experimentation.",
